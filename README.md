## ‚ú® *Never dine alone; come dine with us!*
No one likes to eat alone, and no one wants extra food (especially when it's homemade!) to go to waste‚Äîcome-dine-with.us solves both problems in one!

## What we wanted it to do *(our original plans)*
Cooked too much food and not sure what to do about it? Join the come-dine-with.us community! 
Create an account, then login to view and make posts about sharing extra food with users nearby.

Unfortunately, not everything went as planned and we weren't able to implement a completely functional app we had originally thought out.

## How we built it
* We created a Flask app with the help of a few tutorials
* We used HTML and CSS for the user interface, which was developed with a mobile-first approach, and added Bootstrap styles
* We implemented login and register functionality through Flask extensions like SQL-Alchemy (along with SQLite), Flask-Migrate, Flask-Session and more

## üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Challenges we ran into
* 4 passionate people from all around the world met up in Discord to work on this project. Naturally, the time zone difference and communication barrier made it hard to communicate efficiently.
* A lot had to be learned in a very limited period of time.
* It was quite difficult to figure out how SQL-Alchemy and Flask-Migrate went together and to configure the database for our custom purposes.
* CSS decided to be weird as usual, especially with vertical centering.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
* Creating a full-stack website with everyone contributing equal parts.
* Implementing a chatbot
* For most of us, learning entire languages and/or frameworks in less than 48 hours!

## What we learned
* Teamwork makes the dreamwork, for sure. üåà

## What's next for come-dine-with.us
* Addition of a mapping API or feature to find places near you
