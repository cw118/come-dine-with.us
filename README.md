## 💡Inspiration
No one likes to eat alone, and no one wants extra food (especially when it's homemade!) to go to waste—come-dine-with.us solves both problems in one!

## ⚙️What it does
* Cooked too much food and not sure what to do about it? Join the come-dine-with.us community! 
Create an account, then log in to view and make posts about sharing extra food with users nearby.
* Filter the selections.

## 🛠How we built it
* We created a Flask app with the help of a few tutorials.
* We used HTML and CSS for the user interface, which was developed with a mobile-first approach, and added Bootstrap styles.
* We implemented login and register functionality through Flask extensions like SQL-Alchemy (along with SQLite), Flask-Migrate, Flask-Session and more.
* We have a chatbot that was developed and hosted in google cloud. The bot takes questions about come-dine-with.us and the platform features.

## 🙅🏻‍♀️ Challenges we ran into
* 4 passionate people from all around the world met up in Discord to work on this project. Naturally, the time zone difference and communication barrier made it hard to communicate efficiently.
* A lot had to be learned in a very limited period of time, and we had very ambitious plans for this project (lots of features).
* It was quite difficult to figure out how SQL-Alchemy and Flask-Migrate went together and to configure the database for our custom purposes.
* CSS decided to be weird (as usual), especially with vertical centering.
* Figuring out web development as we go.

## 📌Accomplishments that we're proud of 
* Creating a full-stack website with everyone contributing equal parts.
* For most of us, learning entire languages and/or frameworks in less than 48 hours!
* Being on the same page despite the time zone difference and minimal communication.

## 📚What we learned
* Teamwork makes the dreamwork, for sure. 🌈
* Forming a database using SQLAlchemy and integrating it into our Python code.
* Communication is key in any group work!

## 🗓What's next for come-dine-with.us
* Addition of a mapping API or feature to find places near you
* Sign in using cloud accounts like Google, GitHub, etc.
* Layer of extra security and verification methods to remove users with malicious intent.
