# Introduction
* Have you ever accidentally cooked 3 servings of pasta for your dinner? AND you live alone?
* Ever wanted to share your food with your neighbourhood but too shy to go up to their doorsteps and ask?
* No one likes to eat alone, and no one wants extra food (especially when it's homemade!) to go to waste â€” come-dine-with.us solves both problems in one!

# Demo
* First, create an account and log in using our website.
* Then search for something that you have been craving for. Cookies? Pasta? Pizza?
* We also have a chatbot - meet BotDiny! This smart chatbot will help you make your decision easier.
* After a nice conversation with the friendly bot you have your selections made for you, and now all you need to do is enjoy the scrumptious dish.
* Meeting new people and having fun conversations with nice strangers are definitely an add on!

# Conclusion
